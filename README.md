# Cplusplus-Program


The project was to create a program that took users input for investment amount, interest, monthly contribution, and number of years and display their accounts yearly with and without monthly deposits. This was solving the problem of if people invest monthly instead of just larger chunks annually it can create a large difference in their end investment amounts. 

I thought that in this project I was able to get my formatting done better than usual. Using sset wtidth and fill to make sure the output to the user looked nice and clean was very important for this project and I believe it was a strongsuit for me. 

What could inhance my code would be limiting main to as little as possible and creating more functions. Right now the menu and table printouts are still in menu and I could make those functions and clean it up more.

The pieces of code that I found most challenging for this project was the math at times. I would think that it looked right but then run it against the example output and be off by a slim margin. Learning how to do math with loops did certainly throw me for a loop there and took me a few tries to fully grasp.

The skill from this project that I think will be transferable to other projects and course wrok is the clean output that I was talking about earlier. I do believe that is overlooked in a lot of the work I do since I am more concerned about the program working instead of how it looks.

I attempted to make this code maintable, readable, and adaptable by creating functions, trying to comment on just about everything and their functions/purpose, and trying to keep everything organized.
